<h1>Just practicing my golang skills.</h1> The base for this project is youtube video. But i dont like this, so Im trying to create my own service based on this idea and some configurations

<h2>To Sum up</h2>
This application is deployed on the server using the Selectel service. But deploy.yaml is correct(Check actions)<br />
Itâ€™s impossible to test it in the Internet, because cloud storage is beyond my means.<br />
Therefore, to test this application, you will need to install it locally, add your .env file with all the necessary data (see postgres.go file).<br />
Then, by launching the application using go run /cmd/main.go, check requests through services such as Postman

<h2>Examples of requests</h2>

> **For modificating requests you need to pass BasicAuth params user=igor; password=12345**

> **Add new url with alias request**

localhost:8082/url

```

> **Redirect to existing url**
